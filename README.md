# Data-visualization-using-R
A project on data visualization using R.
It is helps in student result analysis using data visualization.
The data used was the first semester result of B.E. students.
The project is a web application which visualizes the student result data built using shinyApp in R programming language.
The project reads data from a csv file to plot different graphs.
The first tab of the web application plots a histogram for the theory marks received by the students in each subject. The graph of the marks of each subject can be viewed by choosing the corresponding radio button.
The second tab is same as that of the first tab save that it displays a plot for the team work marks.
The third tab displays the pass vs fail histogram for each subject as well as for the overall result by selecting the respective radio button.
The fourth tab displays the table of marks of the students. On selecting a particular student, it displays the histogram of the marks obtained by that student in various subjects.
ggplot2, shiny, DT, shinythemes, shinywidgets libraries were used for the project.
The project gives the user a better insight of the student result because of the visualizations.
